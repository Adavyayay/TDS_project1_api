    "page_content": "Tools in Data Science - May 2025\nis a practical diploma level data science course at IIT Madras that teaches\npopular tools for sourcing data, transforming it, analyzing it, communicating these as visual stories, and deploying them in production.\nThis course exposes you to real-life tools\nCourses teach you programming and data science. From statistics to algorithms to writing Python code to building models.\nBut one critical subject that's rarely covered is: what tools should I pick and how do I become proficient in them?\nThese tools might not help your CV much. But they will make things easier in real life. For example, at school:\nYou learn from pristine datasets. But in the industry, you'll have to scrape them yourself.\nYou learn how to train models. But soon, you'll just pick something from HuggingFace.\nYou learn to write a log parser over weeks. Instead, your boss writes a sed + grep script in minutes.\nIn this course, we've curated the most important tools people use in data science.\nLearn them well. You'll be a **_lot_ more productive** than your peers.\nThis course is quite hard\nHere's students' feedback:\nIt _used_ to be an easy course until 2024.\n[#](",

A signature called BOM (Byte Order Mark)helps computers know exactly how to read text files correctly.\nLearn how Unicode, UTF-8 and character encoding works. This is a common gotcha when building apps that handle international text - something bootcamps often skip but developers and data scientists regularly face in the real world.\nUnicode is fundamental for data scientists working with international data.

They're perfect for small web tools that _don't need to run all the time_. Here are some common real-life uses:\nA contact form that emails you when someone wants to hire you (runs for 2-3 seconds, a few times per day)\nA tool that converts uploaded photos to black and white (runs for 5-10 seconds when someone uploads a photo)\nA chatbot that answers basic questions about your business hours (runs for 1-2 seconds per question)\nA newsletter sign-up that adds emails to your mailing list (runs for 1 second per sign-up)\nA webhook that posts your Etsy sales to Discord (runs for 1 second whenever you make a sale)\nYou only pay when someone uses your tool, and the platform automatically handles busy periods. For example, if 100 people fill out your contact form at once, the platform creates 100 temporary copies of your code to handle them all. When they're done, these copies disappear. It's cheaper than running a full-time server because you're not paying for the time when no one is using your tool - most tools are idle 95% of the time!\nRather than writing a full program, serverless platforms let you write functions. These functions are called via HTTP requests. They run in a cloud environment and are scaled up and down automatically. But this means you write programs in a different style. For example:\nYou can't pip install packages - you have to use requirements.txt\nYou can't read or write files from the file system - you can only use APIs.\nYou can't run commands (e.g. subprocess.run())",

It's essential when you need to transmit binary data through text-only channels or embed binary content in text formats.\nWatch this quick explanation of how Base64 works (3 min):\nHere's how it works:\nIt takes 3 bytes (24 bits) and converts them into 4 ASCII characters\n... using 64 characters: A-Z, a-z, 0-9, + and / (padding with = to make the length a multiple of 4)\nThere's a URL-safe variant of Base64 that replaces + and / with - and \\_ to avoid issues in URLs\nBase64 adds ~33% overhead (since every 3 bytes becomes 4 characters)\nCommon Python operations with Base64:\npython\nimport base64\nBasic encoding/decoding\ntext = \"Hello, World!\"\nConvert text to base64\nencoded = base64.b64encode(text.encode()).decode() # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\nConvert base64 back to text\ndecoded = base64.b64decode(encoded).decode() # Hello, World!\nConvert to URL-safe base64\nurl_safe = base64.urlsafe_b64encode(text.encode()).decode() # SGVsbG8sIFdvcmxkIQ==\nWorking with binary files (e.g., images)\nwith open('image.png', 'rb') as f:\nbinary_data = f.read()\nimage_b64 = base64.b64encode(binary_data).decode()\nData URI example (embed images in HTML/CSS)\ndata_uri = f\"data:image/png;base64,{image_b64}\"\nData URIs allow embedding binary data directly in HTML/CSS.

Each number represents a feature, and similar texts will have numbers close to each other. So, if the numbers are similar, the text they represent mean something similar.\nThis is useful because text similarity is important in many common problems:\n1. **Search**. Find similar documents to a query.\n2. **Classification**. Classify text into categories.\n3. **Clustering**. Group similar items into clusters.\n4. **Anomaly Detection**. Find an unusual piece of text.\nYou can run embedding models locally or using an API. Local models are better for privacy and cost. APIs are better for scale and quality.\n| Feature | Local Models | API |\n| ----------- | -------------------------- | ------------------------- |\n| **Privacy** | High | Dependent on provider |\n| **Cost** | High setup, low after that | Pay-as-you-go |\n| **Scale** | Limited by local resources | Easily scales with demand |\n| **Quality** | Varies by model | Typically high |\nThe provides comprehensive comparisons of embedding models. These models are compared on several parameters, but here are some key ones to look at:\n1. **Rank**. Higher ranked models have higher quality.\n2. **Memory Usage**. Lower is better (for similar ranks). It costs less and is faster to run.\n3. **Embedding Dimensions**. Lower is better. This is the number of numbers in the array. Smaller dimensions are cheaper to store.\n4. **Max Tokens**. Higher is better. This is the number of input tokens (words) the model can take in a _single_ input.\n5. Look for higher scores in the columns for Classification, Clustering, Summarization, etc. based on your needs.\nLocal Embeddings\nHere's a minimal example using a local embedding model:\n`python\n/// script\nrequires-python = \"==3.12",

Unlike simple prompt-response patterns, agents make multiple LLM calls, use tools, and adapt their approach based on intermediate results. They represent a significant step toward more autonomous AI systems.\nWhat Makes an Agent?\nAn LLM agent consists of three core components:\n1. **LLM Brain**: Makes decisions about what to do next\n2. **Tools**: External capabilities the agent can use (e.g., web search, code execution)\n3. **Memory**: Retains context across multiple steps\nAgents operate through a loop:\nObserve the environment\nThink about what to do\nTake action using tools\nObserve results\nRepeat until task completion\nCommand-Line Agent Example\nWe've created a minimal command-line agent called [llm-cmd-agent.py](llm-cmd-agent.py \":ignore\") that:\n1. Takes a task description from the command line\n2. Generates code to accomplish the task\n3. Automatically extracts and executes the code\n4. Passes the results back to the LLM\n5. Provides a final answer or tries again if the execution fails\nHere's how it works:\nbash\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"list all Python files under the current directory, recursively, by size\"\nuv run llm-cmd-agent.py \"convert the largest Markdown file to HTML\"\nThe agent will:\n1. Generate a shell script to list files with their sizes\n2. Execute the script in a subprocess\n3. Capture the output (stdout and stderr)\n4. Pass the output back to the LLM for interpretation\n5. Present a final answer to the user\nUnder the hood, the agent follows this workflow:\n1. Initial prompt to generate a shell script\n2. Code extraction from the LLM response\n3. Code execution in a subprocess\n4. Result interpretation by the LLM\n5. Error handling and retry logic if needed\nThis demonstrates the core agent loop of:\nPlanning (generating code)\nExecution (running",

The first is you can **download** the data. Either somebody gives you the data and says download it from here, or you are asked to download it from the internet because it's a public data source. But that's the first way—you download the data.\n2. The second way is you can **query it** from somewhere. It may be on a database. It may be available through an API. It may be available through a library. But these are ways in which you can selectively query parts of the data and stitch it together.\n3. The third way is you have to **scrape it**. It's not directly available in a convenient form that you can query or download. But it is, in fact, on a web page. It's available on a PDF file. It's available in a Word document. It's available on an Excel file. It's kind of structured, but you will have to figure out that structure and extract it from there.\nIn this module, we will be looking at the tools that will help you either download from a data source or query from an API or from a database or from a library. And finally, how you can scrape from different sources.\nHere are links used in the video:",

For example:\nContent analysis**: Extract clean text from HTML for natural language processing\nData mining**: Strip formatting to focus on the actual content\nOffline reading**: Convert web pages to readable formats for e-readers or offline consumption\nContent migration**: Move content between different CMS platforms\nSEO analysis**: Extract headings, content structure, and text for optimization\nArchive creation**: Store web content in more compact, preservation-friendly formats\nAccessibility**: Convert content to formats that work better with screen readers\nThis tutorial covers both converting existing HTML files and combining web crawling with HTML-to-text conversion in a single workflow -- all using the command line.\ndefuddle-cli\nspecializes in HTML - Markdown conversion.

Before working with messy production data, you need a controlled environment to test data cleaning techniques.

Data rarely arrives clean. Export systems fail, manual data entry introduces errors, and third-party integrations send malformed files. Learning to handle corrupted CSV files prevents hours of debugging and ensures your data pipeline doesn't break when inevitably receiving bad data from vendors, APIs, or legacy systems.\n`bash\ncat <<'EOF' > messy_orders.csv\norder_id,customer,order_date,product,amount,region\n1,Customer 1,2025-01-01,Widget 1,100,US\n\"2,Customer 2,2025-01-02,Gadget 2,200,US\n3,Customer",

Rather than excluding entire records and losing valuable information, strategic imputation preserves data for analysis while clearly marking assumptions made during the cleaning process.\nReplace null customer names\nSELECT COALESCE(customer, 'Unknown') AS customer FROM orders;\nString Operations\nIt's common to standardize text data that comes from multiple sources with inconsistent formatting. Product names from different suppliers use varying cases, customer entries have extra spaces, and imported data contains mixed formatting. Clean, consistent strings enable accurate grouping for inventory management, prevent duplicate customer records, and ensure search functionality works properly across your application.\nSELECT DISTINCT TRIM(LOWER(product)) AS clean_product FROM orders;\nDate Parsing and Conversion\nTypically, we transform dates into different formats that enable time-based business analysis. Raw date strings from different systems use various formats that prevent proper sorting and filtering. Converting to standard formats enables monthly sales reporting, seasonal trend analysis, and time-based customer segmentation - critical for inventory planning, marketing campaigns, and financial forecasting.\nSELECT order_id, STRFTIME(order_date, '%Y-%m') AS order_month FROM orders;\nConditional Logic and Binning\nA common task is to categorize continuous data into meaningful business segments that drive decision-making. Converting exact dollar amounts into price tiers enables targeted marketing (premium vs budget customers), inventory classification (high/medium/low value items), and commission structures.

Business analysis rarely needs all data - marketing teams want current customers, finance needs profitable regions, and product managers focus on active items. Efficient filtering reduces processing time, protects sensitive data (removing PII columns), and ensures analysis focuses on business-relevant subsets rather than getting lost in comprehensive but unfocused datasets.\nSELECT order_id, amount FROM orders WHERE region = 'US';\nSELECT * EXCLUDE region FROM orders;\nDerived Columns\nNow, let's create new business metrics from existing data that drive key performance indicators.

In this tutorial, we'll explore tools to flatten, stream, and query JSON data efficiently.\nFor example, we'll often need to process a multi-gigabyte log file from a web service where each record is a JSON object.\nThis requires us to handle complex nested structures, large files that don't fit in memory, or extract specific fields. Here are the key tools and techniques for efficient JSON parsing:\n| Tool | Extract from JSON... | Why |\n| ------------------------------------------- | ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |\n| [jq](#command-line-json-processing-with-jq) | JSON in the shell | Quick data exploration and pipeline processing |\n| [JMESPath](#jmespath-queries) | JSON in Python | Handle complex queries with a clean syntax |\n| [ijson](#streaming-with-ijson) | JSON streams in Python | Parse streaming/large JSON files memory-efficiently |\n| [Pandas](#pandas-json-columns) | JSON columns in Python | Fast analysis of structured data |\n| [SQL JSON](#sql-json-functions) | JSON in databases | Combine structured and semi-structured data |\n| [DuckDB](#duckdb-json-processing) | JSON anywhere | Fast analysis of JSON files / databases without loading to memory |\nExamples:**\nUse Pandas when you need to transform API responses into a DataFrame for further analysis.\nLeverage ijson when dealing with huge JSON logs where memory is at a premium.\nApply jq for quick, iterative exploration directly in your terminal.\nPractice with these resources:\n: Test JSON queries\n: Interactive jq query testing\n: Learn DuckDB JSON functions\nCommand-line JSON Processing with jq\nis a versatile command-line tool for slicing, filtering, and transforming JSON. It excels in quick data exploration",

With GitHub codespaces you can use Ubuntu os, and visually it gives you feel of vs code. You can also active your GitHub student developer pack and get 180 hours of GitHub codespaces and some more benefits such as cloud resources and domains.\nI have done all questions of week1 and week2 on codespaces only, codespaces works very well if you have good internet connection.\nR23: Hi samra,\nTry installing some other browser see if that works.\nR24: Hi mishkat,\nWithout sharing code, can you pls share your approach how you are trying to solve this question.",

Could you kindly clarify the situation?\nThank you and Regards\nAkshit\nR1: Yes, I also missed the same assignment due to pressure from other courses.\nHowever, awarding a 5-mark bonus instead of a percentile-based system like GA4 seems quite different.\nIs this information available to everyone sir?\nR2: Hello .anand sir,\nI hope you are doing well.\nAs per the grading document, we were informed that only the best 4 out of the 7 assessments would be considered for grading. However, there was no mention of bonus marks, and before the deadline, we were not informed about the +5 bonus marks for GA7. Due to other academic commitments, such as Project 2, some of us were unable to complete GA7.\nNow, we have come to know that some of our peers have received an email stating that they have been awarded +5 bonus marks, which directly contribute to the final score. In some cases, this may even impact the final grade. Since this information was not communicated earlier, we kindly request you to consider providing an alternative way for those who missed GA7 to earn these bonus marks—perhaps through reviewing submissions or another form of assessment.\nWe sincerely request your understanding on this matter and would be grateful if you could provide an opportunity for us to earn the bonus marks as well.\nLooking forward to your kind consideration.\nBest regards,\nDigvijaysinh Chudasama\nR3: The Same happened to me.

Initially, we were told that GA would carry 15% weight, calculated as the best 4 out of 7. Based on this, after scoring full marks in four GAs, I didn’t attempt the rest. Even then, I did complete GA5 and GA6, which you can verify.\nNow I’m seeing in groups that there’s an “extra benefit” being given for GA7. If any changes are being made to the evaluation criteria, they should be communicated clearly via email or discourse. Transparency is important, and as students, we have the right to be informed about such decisions in advance.\nI could point out several other issues, but to keep it brief — grading should be fair and consistent. Every student deserves an equal opportunity, and if GA7 is being considered differently, everyone should have the chance to attempt or review it accordingly.\nsir please look into this\nR17:\nYes sir , we have completed all the previous ga but not able to do week 7 , we feel that the bonus should be given to all on the basis of ga and not only on week 7 . Or it should have been informed earlier if such bonus was to be given . Please do consider our request . Thank you\nR18: Exactly , They have to informed this earlier , that week 7 have peer marks too , and now bonus too\nin the grading doc , they removed peer marks , so i thought it was removed , but its not\nR19: .anand\nThe sudden introduction of bonus marks for GA7 in Tools in Data Science has left many students confused, as there was no prior intimation regarding this change. We had all planned our submissions based on the clearly communicated “best 4 out of 7” policy. This unexpected shift has raised concerns about transparency and fairness principles that should be central to academic assessment. Fairness is not a privilege to be selectively granted; it is a fundamental right for every student. We respectfully urge the course coordinators",

I request you to please consider evaluating the project.\nScreenshot 2025-04-02 at 4.49.23 PM1776×228 15.5 KB\nI completely appreciate that you feel these are minor issues.\nBut the team has decided that we cannot allow students to make changes to their repos. Because someone else might have another minor issue they want to fix. We have to apply the rule uniformly.\nUnfortunately we cannot allow submissions that fail the prerequisites.\nChanging it now will not suddenly make it eligible.\nThese things do matter when done at scale. Its an important lesson Anand wants students to understand. These “minor” things matter.\nIts a bit like assembling a rocket and forgetting the checklist for the pilot. Minor detail, costs Rs 2, but the rocket cannot leave without it.\nWe had a significant discussion about it internally. For the sake of fairness to everyone who got it right, we cannot allow edits after the Project deadline. It makes the prerequisites meaningless, especially when it was clearly stressed upon in the sessions and the Project page.\nI know you will feel very disappointed but it is the decision the team has made and I have shared the reasons why.\nKindest regards\nR6: Sir,\nThankyou for your prompt reply to my query.\nI wanted to let you know that i had made change of ‘LICENSE’ to ‘MIT LICENSE’ on the 16th of Feb itself as that was the day that i had received the mail and because I saw that the submission date had been extended by one day(i.e the 16th of Feb itself).\nI completely understand what you are trying to convey but that",

Additionally, due to an unforeseen emergency, I was unable to write the ROE exam, which resulted in lost marks. This makes it even more crucial for me to perform well in this project to make up for it.\nI sincerely request if it would be possible to extend the deadline by 2 days. This would allow me to put in my best effort and submit quality work. I truly value this opportunity and would be extremely grateful for your consideration.\nThank you for your time and understanding.\nR1: A little more time will help us deploy properly as well. please allow for some more time. Even when working in groups and mixing and matching code… the real messy work is debugging and deployment due to the sheer variety of it. Some are deploying on AWS, some on scalingo, some on Digitalocean, some on Render, some on Azure… even helping amongst ourselves is getting complex because of this.",

However, I won’t be able to present the project in a public session as my Azure API URL would be exposed, and since it incurs costs per usage, I need to keep it secure.\nI’d prefer a private meet to demonstrate the project. Please let me know if that can be arranged. Looking forward to discussing it!\nR3: That’s amazing ,\nso far I have completed till 44 Qs and deployed it on azure too !! Mine is solving around 40 correctly out of these 44 (checked with another user’s login on the portal).\nI can’t join the meet since I’m out of station and don’t have PC access.

I am writing to highlight several issues and doubts related to different aspects of the course that require clarification and resolution.\n1.

The deadline has passed, but no solutions have been provided. (Thread link)\nGA Platform Changes: Initially, we were solving questions on exam.sanand.workers.dev . However, in GA6, we moved to Seek and in GA7, to Google Forms. The issue is that in GA6, we cannot check our answers like we could in previous assignments.\n2.

Any update on this would be helpful.\nProject 2: There are multiple doubts posted in the Project 2 discussion thread, but they have not been addressed yet.

    "page_content": " evaluations from the seek portal to the TDS server. Since the move to the new TDS server on the back end, we are able to also directly see students actual parameterised questions whenever doubts are raised. This is NOT possible on seek portal for us. The results are immediate to see. You got timely rapid feedback for GA 1 to GA 5 from the TAs. The TAs were also able to iterate quickly in discussion with the instructors and the professor as well as operations.\nWith GA 6 our inability to actually see your individual question sets immediately (its possible, but it has to take a very circuitous route via 3 set of people) meant we were always on the back foot for both, checking the answers, as well as making any corrections. And since the questions were parameterised, for technical reasons it was extremely cumbersome/risky/impossible to make changes without it being VERY disruptive to all students. These were some of the reasons we are transitioning. We have seen this problem term after term in prior terms with regards to the seek portal. This is a technological limitation of the current seek portal that directly impacts our ability to react to a dynamic course like TDS.\nGA 7 was decided to submit via forms again for the reasons listed above. GA6 was straightforward because it was a traditional evaluation. Whereas GA7 is once again very unique and does not handle well in being configured in Seek Portal. Since it was not possible in such a short time to transition GA7 to our preferred hosting server and student favourite, we opted for the least disruptive solution that we are able to action very quickly upon.\nlakshaygarg654:\nProject 1: The result is still awaited, although it was expected on or before March 16. Any update on this would be helpful.\nProject 1 evaluations is VERY computationally intensive for us to evaluate. Each project although dockerised, with an average submission weighing at 2GB, we have to provision space of 1 TB along with the cloud computer resources for all of that (RAM and vCPUs) and if you thought creating project 1 was tough, you can imagine the technical challenge involved in evaluating the 600+ submissions with all the errors and issues we have to fix. In truth its all hands on deck for us here on the back end because it has been deemed critical. So while we are moving the course along, we are also aware that evaluations are at serious risk of missing crucial deadlines",

Please read reply to the original poster.\nThanks,\nKind regards\nR4: Thank you for your response and for addressing our concerns. We appreciate the efforts of the entire team in ensuring a smooth transition and improving the course experience.\nThe reason for raising this separate post is that multiple doubts related to the course have been left unanswered over the past few days. Even if the course team provides a response without an immediate resolution, it would help us understand the ongoing process and what to expect next.\nWe will wait for the resolution of GA6 issues and the release of Project 1 results. Regarding ROE, we initially assumed that marks would be awarded in the same manner as GA4 (110/100); however, now that you have clarified the maximum marks is 100.\nMeanwhile, we would like to know if a session can be arranged to discuss the solution for Project 1. This would be beneficial for us in working on Project 2. Additionally, any updates regarding the pending queries for Project 2 would be greatly appreciated.\nLooking forward to your response.\nRegards,\nLakshay",

The first part is the TAs solving the Mock in real time (however this is not a solutions session). The purpose of it is to get you to realise some key things:\nThe chaos of ROE.\nThe adrenaline, speed of thought, the need to be very familiar with your tools.\nThe limited time you have to use GPT effectively. It will help you with minor work flows, but not with complex tasks. (watch the session debrief to hear a clear articulation about this).\nThe value of efficient and effective collaboration. A hodgepodge of many people will not make an effective solutions team.\nThe ABSOLUTE importance of creating your own cheat sheet with code snippets that will help you solve ROE quickly\nWorkflow of ROE: Data Extraction → Data Cleaning → Data Transformation → Data Analyisis → Information to answer questions\nThe pitfalls of getting fixated on a question (a very common mistake and you can see it happen in the real time solving session as well).\nHow limited the time is.\nThe second part of the session was a debrief for the sheer shock that students felt. The goal of the mock was to acclimatise you to the shock of ROE.\nPast terms never had this benefit. We thought to take the shock factor out so that you can be better prepared than any term before. Emotions were raw. But this is normal. What is unusual is to have a preview of it before ROE. So the discussions were very intense even for us.\nToday’s Mock ROE will be more like a traditional solving session and deal with new aspects. It has the added bonus of being hosted on an exam server (without a time limit).\nI would still STRONGLY advise setting a horrible sounding alarm to acclimatise to the pressure cooker of ROE. You will make stupid mistakes under pressure. The TAs did yesterday as well. So best",

    "page_content": "Q: Dear\nFirst and foremost, we sincerely appreciate the efforts of the TDS team in supporting us throughout this course. The live sessions and guidance have been helpful, and we recognize the intent to make this a valuable learning experience.\nHowever, despite these efforts, many of us have faced significant challenges in keeping up with the course expectations.\nKey Challenges Faced\nLack of Prerequisites\nThis course did not list any prerequisites, leading many students—including those from non-technical backgrounds—to enroll with the expectation that they could keep up. However, the reality is that the course content, assignments, and projects have been far more complex than anticipated, making it difficult to manage.\nProject Complexity & Deadline Pressure\nThe difficulty of the projects has been overwhelming, requiring most of us to rely heavily on peer support just to meet the deadlines. Despite putting in our best efforts, many of us struggled to complete them successfully.\nCourse Structure Changes & Misleading Past Feedback\nMany students joined TDS based on past Discourse posts and feedback, which suggested a different course structure. With the recent changes, it has been a tough transition—especially for working professionals and students without prior experience.\nRemote Open Exam (RoE) & Graded Assignments (GAs)\nWhile we have put in significant effort—spending 2-3 days on Graded Assignments (GAs) to secure good scores—we still find ourselves struggling to meet expectations for the projects and RoE, which are significantly harder than anticipated.\nWe completely understand the need to maintain academic standards, but we also hope fairness is considered. Since many of us are putting in our best efforts but still finding it hard to meet the course demands, we kindly request a revision of the grading pattern. Increasing the weightage of Graded Assignments (GAs) would help ensure that the dedication and hard work of students are fairly reflected in their grades. This would allow students to pass with a reasonable grade while still maintaining the integrity of the course.\nWe truly respect the effort that has gone into designing this course, and we are all here because we genuinely want to learn and grow. We only ask that the grading structure consider the diverse backgrounds of students so that everyone has a fair chance to succeed.\nThank you for your time and understanding. We appreciate your consideration and hope to find a way forward that benefits both students and the course objectives.\nR1: Yes sir please look into this\nR2: Yes ma’am please pay attention to our concern",

I still am not able to fully grasp the concept.\nI tried to attempt today’s mock roe, it was a disaster. I hope I can do better on next mock.\nI completed my project but due to some issue I failed to submit it. That’s was my mistake, and I highly regret it. I lost 20 marks because of it despite working so hard.\nR6: Hi .anand\nCould you please look into the above issue?\nAdditionally, I’d like to highlight a concern regarding the current grading pattern ( JAN 2025 Term ) and overall course structuring:\nGrading Concerns\nFinal Course Score:\nT = 0.15GAA + 0.2 ROE1 + 0.2 P1 + 0.2 P2 + 0.25 F\n(The weightage of Projects + ROE accounts for 60% of the total score.)\nFrom the following Discourse post, it appears that the ROE exam is extremely difficult to the point of being considered “impossible” by students:\nWhat’s the actual purpose of impossible ROE exam?.\nGiven this, many students may directly lose 20 marks due to ROE, significantly impacting their overall scores.\nFurthermore, for Project 1 (deadline: 16th Feb 2025), guidance was provided only in the week of the deadline. This was highly inconvenient, as the live session did not effectively address all student concerns. As a result, many students are at risk of losing a valuable 20 marks for Project 1.\nCourse Structuring & Scheduling Issues\nMany students pursuing this course are dual-degree students or working professionals, making it challenging to keep up with live sessions and deadlines.\nThe last-minute guidance for projects adds unnecessary pressure, especially for those juggling work or other academic commitments.\nThe structuring and scheduling of sessions feel inappropriate, with crucial guidance sessions being held too late, making it difficult to implement feedback or clarify doubts in time.\nRequest for Improvement\nTo ensure a smoother learning experience, I request:\nEarly",

Looking forward to your response.\nR7: Please look into it sir.\nR8: Thank you for the detailed post. This is much appreciated. Thought of quickly stepping in before Anand or other members from the course team gives a more detailed response.\nLet me be Open and Blunt to all in saying that the grading pattern will not be changed. And the points below are some of quick things that came to my mind while reading the detailed listing of the challenges that have been put in the OP.\nTDS team have been tinkering with the course structure for the past 3 terms. You can check this Discourse thread where students have unanimously said that this is not an easy subject. In fact the first page of the TDS course GA1 itself should have given everyone an indication of what lies ahead. Anand has explicitly written down the below words:\nThis course is quite hard\nHere’s students’ feedback:\nIt used to be an easy course until 2024. # # #\nNow it’s hard and covers more. Take it in your last semester if possible. # # #\nPlan extra time. It takes more time than typical 3-credit courses. # # #\nLLMs grade you – unpredictably. # #\nThe ROE is hard. #\nTake Graded assignment 1 to check if you’re ready for this course. Please drop this course (do it in a later term) if you score low. It’ll be too tough for you now.\nTDS (or for that matter any course in this Degree program) is not supposed to be a single person effort. You should be realizing this even in your real life. A significant part of our learning process is social by nature. The only difference in this course is that we we explicitly encourage you to collaborate. If there is one main life lesson that we want you to learn out of this course then it is just this - Surviving tough situations require support all around us, and there is no shame in asking for help\nAgain to quote Anand:\nWe encourage learning by sharing\nYou CAN copy from friends. You can work in groups. You",

You’ll be working in teams on the shoulders of giants. It’s important to learn how to do that well.\nTo learn well, understand what you’re copying. If you’re short of time, prioritize.\nTo learn better, teach what you’ve learnt.\nNow will be a good point to reflect on the optimization problem of Grades versus Learning. The larger question for each of you is to consider the short-term advantage of better grades versus the long term advantage of improving the fundamentals related to tools usage (not just for Data Science, but in every day life itself).\nOnce again Anand has a nice blog where [I think] he is trying to explain that neither do we know nor do students realize what is going to ultimately benefit us. This is a journey that all of us are taking together, and we hope such open interactions along with the course will make the learning (or teaching) experience enjoyable and internally make us more humble.\nWhether you like it or not, life is becoming more complex day by day. And unless you figure out your optimization strategy, it is going to be a bumpy ride. And this is true even for the TDS course team members. Each of us are also juggling multiple responsibilities (some even doing 4 projects in this term) while ensuring that needed support can be provided to the learners. This is not lighten the issues that any of you have highlighted here, but just to point out that there is no flowery path for anyone here.\nThen the major question will be, why are all of doing this crazy business of learning tools in this way. The simplest answer is - Tools are evolving day by day, and unless we realize that they are just “tools”, it is going to consume us an eternity to master them The point of all the exercises and assessments, is for you to understand the fundamental aspects related to a tool and figure out your own strategies for getting a grip on them.\nManagement of time and difficulty levels are a shared responsibility. All of you have been sufficiently warned that the learning process wont be easy. In fact we have released all major content well in advance, so that learners can benefit from early access. And from our side, we also have realized the supporting learners wouldn’t be easy. But I see that the TDS course",

I want to invest myself in the ROE and the remaining project, but at this point I’m so frustrated about getting at least 40 that rather than a valuable learning experience, this course seems like a burden to me.\nI understand that the grading can’t be changed.

I wanted to check if it is mandatory to attempt the mock at 7 PM or if there is flexibility in the timing. As a working professional, I may not be able to attempt the mock at 7 PM.\nCould you please confirm if there is any flexibility in the timings? Additionally, I would appreciate it if you could provide details on when and how the mock links will be shared.\nThanks and Regards\nShalini\nR1: Tag the TAs and instructor. Otherwise, you may not get the answer in time…\nR2: It is not mandatory to attempt mocks at 7pm. But we will solve it in real time during the session. Thats why we are releasing it 1 hour before. We will freeze the form submissions during the solving session and then reopen it later.\nROE is not like other exams you have done so far in this entire diploma.\nSolving it leisurely will give you a false sense of your capabilities.\nThe truth is everyone can get full marks for ROE given enough time.\nThe problem is the lack of time.\nSo if you want to really check ROE readiness, fix the timer alarm for 45 mins and attempt it genuinely within the 45 mins. Only then will you know where you stand.\nAdditionally, each ROE is completely different from the next. If you manage to do good in one is ZERO guarantee that you will do good in the next.\nThats why do all 4 mock ROEs. ROE is not like any other exam. Other exams have the same types of questions. Not with ROE.\nThe real ROE will be also something that no one has seen before.\nBut we will help you be as ready as possible for it.\nKind regards\nR3: hi\nhow are we supposed to give the mock ROE? where can I find the link? should i join gmeet while solving mock ROE or is it non-proctored? kindly clarify these doubts. thanks in advance!\nR4: You will get an email at 7pm with the ROE dataset and the question form.\nI will also add the same in the student seek portal.\nMock ROEs are not proctored (its a mock!) and the actual ROE is not proctored either!\nThe gmeet is after the mock ROE where it will be solved live by the",

Please check into this question once as I have cross checked with many of the students and chatgpt and all of us faced this issue in this question. Thanks!\n.anand\ncode to take reference from:\nimport gzip\nimport pandas as pd\nfrom datetime import datetime\nlog_path = 's-anand.net-May-2024.gz'\nstart_time = datetime.strptime('01:00:00', '%H:%M:%S').time()\nend_time = datetime.strptime('15:00:00', '%H:%M:%S').time()\nlog_data = []\ndef parse_log(line):\nparts = line.split(' ')\nlog_time = datetime.strptime(parts[3][1:], '%d/%b/%Y:%H:%M:%S')\nmethod, url, status = parts[5][1:], parts[6], int(parts[8])\nreturn log_time, method, url, status\nwith gzip.open(log_path, 'rt') as file:\nfor entry in file:\nlog_time, method, url, status = parse_log(entry)\nif method == 'GET' and url.startswith('/blog/') and 200 <= status < 300:\nif log_time.weekday() == 0 and start_time <= log_time.time() < end_time:\nlog_data.append(entry)\nprint(f\"Successful GET requests: {len(log_data)}\")\nps: I shared code after the deadline hopefully no issues there!\nR3: I’m also facing same kind of issue in Q3, GA5, while cross checked answer from different methods getting same result 1603, which is showing incorrect.\nKindly check this issue.\nThanks\nR4: The same issue is being faced by many students, not only for this condition, but others as well. Please look into it\nR5: actually i got 130 as answer. but the answer accepted by the portal was 129. i felt like, i have to change one or two numbers front and back, i tried the same before. it worked\nR6: For the same question?

I am assuming it will have to be changed for Assignment 7 as well.\nPlease let me know rough submission dates if possible so that I can plan accordingly (my schedule in the upcoming days is very hectic).\nR1: GA6 will be released sometime this week. All GAs have a minimum 9 days for submissions.\nWe do not have an ETA for Project 2 yet.\nKind regards\nIf possible, could you inform what weeks the project 2 would be based on (like Project 1 was based on week 3 content). Thanks in advance.\nR3: Project 1 was based on Module 1 through 3.\nProject 2 will encompass Module 4 through 6 (and possibly 7) but not to the exclusion of the prior modules. These are not set in stone and still is in the design/validation phase.\nWe generally avoid calling it week 3 content etc. because all the content was released as modules at the beginning well before the term was started.\nThe GAs are released as we complete validations on them. Each term the course assignments are updated to stay current with industry expectations. So they are not recycled like subjects that are static like maths, statistics and programming which have syllabi that have not changed in 10 years or more.\nWe try to release GAs so that they match the cadence of the other subjects for the convenience of students wherever possible. But rarely do other subjects require constant revalidation for their GAs.\nHence we have situations, even in past terms, where GAs and Projects get moved to allow for robust validations of the answers. In spite of this some errors do slip through due to the aggressive time schedule in a trimester system as opposed to a semester system.\nHope that give you some insight into how TDS works.\nThanks for bearing with us. TDS is perpetually a WIP.\nKind regards",

I request the official post to cover these.\nSyllabus\nkindly hint us on the type of questions, kind of tools to practice\nI did my ROE the last term, the time was not enough for me. I would like to know if it is actually possible to solve all the questions within the time\nAny mock or resource to practice from?\nadditional tips, if any\nModules 1 - 5\nQuestions will be similar to GAs and the content in the modules.\nROE is quite hard. Only a small number will be able to do it in the given time frame.\nWe will have some past ROEs as practise\n… watch sessions\nKind regards\nR2: Thanks for the answer\nIs it safe to assume that ROE is nothing but a “GA with extremely short deadline” since we don’t have proctors ? Or is the ROE more complex structured ?\nP.S. I am not saying the questions will be hard or easy, just asking about structure.\nR3: Sir questions will be of Numeeical type or MCQs type as in earlier batches it was MCQs??\nR4: ROEs are always unique. They can be of any kind. We do not fix one method. Therefore its not possible to say what kind of questions will be there whether MCQ, MSQ or numerical or text etc.\nKind regards\nR5: The ROEs are not GAs with short deadlines. A GA question usually tests one concept in isolation. ROEs typically require you to combine multiple concepts and use multiple tools in order to answer the question. (in a very short time).\nIf your goal is totally rely on the LLM to solve it for you… past experience shows us that ROEs complexity is usually difficult for an LLM to overcome without significant assistance from the “hooomann”\nSo practise with the concepts are going to be key without having to look up everything because looking up everything takes too much time. Collaboration with others is going be helpful. ROE is not proctored and is open internet. There is a reason for that. Its very hard.\nThere will be a dataset or multiple datasets. Sometimes you may have to combine datasets to answer questions. You will have to extract data from the dataset. You will have to transform/c",

In practise though that rarely happens.\nAlso 45 mins is not a given, its a typical time we aim for. It can be shorter or longer depending on the nature of the questions in the ROE.

After several attempts my submission still generated differences from the supposed answers. I have tried all forms of re-punctuations but the error wont budge. I even compared the generated transcript with the actual audio several times. I BELIEVE MY ANSWER IS CORRECT. If not I wish to know what the correct answer is. Because compared to the video I have provided the exact and well punctuated transcription of the audio between 397.2 and 505.5 seconds.\nHere was my transcription - \" Determined to confront the mystery, Miranda followed the elusive figure. In the dim corridor, fleeting glimpses of determination and hidden sorrow emerged, challenging her assumptions of friends and foes alike. The pursuit led her to a narrow, winding passage beneath the chapel. In the oppressive darkness, the air grew cold and heavy, and every echo of her footsteps seemed to whisper warnings of secrets best left undisturbed.\nIn a subterranean chamber, the shadow finally halted. The figure’s voice emerged from the gloom, “You are close to the truth, but be warned some secrets, once uncovered, can never be buried again.”\nThe mysterious stranger introduced himself as Victor, a former confidant of Edmund. His words painted a tale of coercion and betrayal—a network of hidden alliances that had forced Edmond into an impossible choice.\nVictor detailed clandestine meetings, cryptic codes, and a secret society that manipulated fate from behind the scenes. Miranda listened, each revelation tightening the knots of suspicion around her mind.\nFrom within his warm coat, Victor produced a faded journal brimming with names, dates, and enigmatic symbols. Its contents mirrored Edmund’s diary, strengthening the case for a conspiracy rooted in treachery. The journal hinted at a hidden hall beneath the manor, where the secret society stored evidence of their manipulations.\nMiranda’s pulse quickened at the thought of unmasking those responsible for decades of deceit. Returning to the manor’s main hall, Miranda retraced her steps with renewed resolve. Every shadow in the corridor now seemed charged with meaning, each creak of wood a prelude to further revelations. In the manor’s basement, beneath a concealed panel, Miranda discovered another revelation \"\nR1: i downloaded mp3, trimmed the video using ffmpeg and used this\nConvert your MP3 to Text for Free Online, it",

On my local repository it was Dockerfile only I even have a published docker image as verified by you autated script only. The name of the file on remote repository did not change even after commit it through my local repo, once I read the mail in morning it was only then I realised it wasn’t changed on GitHub repo.\nSir I understand the deadline has passed and I am not asking for a resubmission, I am just asking to consider the already submitted work, just that. It would be really helpful. I just have one commit on my repo that too “Rename dockerfile to Dokerfile” . Sir please attest consider what we have already submitted. I have made no changes as you can verify it too.\nSir it is a humble request to please consider it.\nWarm Regards,\nSatvik Sawhney\n23f2003680\nScreenshot 2025-02-18 at 1.53.10 PM1889×467 54 KB",

I request to reconsider the deadline and extend the due date so that it gives slightly more odds of submitting the project.\nThanks\nVikram\nR1: .anand Yes Sir please extend the project deadline.\nR2: yes, it is quite difficult and also the people who have done this course in previous terms are able to help just because of the difficulty. please extend the deadline or give out some resources.\nR3: Yes .anand , ,\nThe project is complex, and an extension would really help reduce our stress and let us submit better work.\nAdditionally, some extra help sessions would be really helpful to clarify our doubts.\nR4: .anand yes sir please extend the project deadline.\nR5: Sir please extend the deadline it’s really hard to do we need more time\nR6: Yes, it’s too hectic to balance work and this project\nR7: .anand sir plss extend deadline as it is taking too much time to understand the project and this is completely new for us, we are trying our best but couldn’t able to make it. Some days extension might reduce our stress and we’ll perform better in the project as this is very important for us.\nR9: .anand sir pls extend the deadline as the GATE DA exam is also scheduled on Saturday\nR10: Please extend the deadline\nR11: .anand sir pls extend the deadline of project1 as it’s very difficult, we are spending so much of time still not able to complete the project and the gate exam is also on 15 February. We would be grateful if the deadline could be extended…\nR12: Please at least make it 16 or 17 Feb. The GATE DA exam and project deadline coinciding has already hampered progress on both ends. At least the project will be much better even with the smallest possible extension.\nR13: Kindly consider the request and extend the deadline sir. It would be really helpful as we could atleast work upto our full potential and submit few tasks increasing the odds of our submission. .anand\nR14: Indeed, even i am stuck in project parts and a lot of them.\nEXTEND !!!\nR15: Kindly consider our request to extend the deadline, as",

A slight extension would be greatly helpful.\nR16: SIr please extend the deadline of project 1 give us 2 to 3 days it was helpful for us.\nR17:\nand others…\nI have discussed this with the rest of the TDS team and with Operations on multiple occasions (including today.) Here are the highlights of the discussion:\nWe have moved Graded Assignment 5 (GA5) deadline which was due on 16th Feb to 21st Feb next Friday.\nAll the material to be able to do Project was available in Module 2 and Module 3, which was released on or before 10th of January (36 days ago)\nProject 1 was released 19th of January (27 days ago)\nWe had over 9 hours of sessions exclusively covering Project 1 (of which at least 8 hours are available on YouTube.) This excludes any week 2 and week 3 content which also would have given you the necessary skills to do Project 1. The sessions on YouTube give you a start to finish overview of how to approach it.\nAll of your concerns were duly noted and mentioned. Considering all the above, including the concerns mentioned by students:\nProject 1 deadline will NOT be changed.\nPlease make sure to carefully read the Deliverables and the Evaluation section and do them carefully and watch the intro to Week 3 - Session 1 to get an overview of what is absolutely essential and required. Watch Week 5 both sessions to see how we construct these requirements.\nKind regards\nTDS Team\nR18: -Yes sir this project 1 is very tough for even 1 question a whole day is used.\n.anand Sir besides this project we have other subject graded assignments and MLP Project and MAD2 project.\nPlease sir it would be very beneficial for everyone, we have talked to other students also we are not able to even complete the 10 A tasks even with the evaluate.py rest aside Task B.\nPlease sir take this into consideration. We are trying very hard for this project even you can see students asking various questions in the discourse, we are struggling but still sir we are trying.\nR19: .anand\nWe truly appreciate the efforts being put by the TDS team, but not to be rude here -\nWhy is Project 1 deadline is on Saturday and not on Sunday, as many of us are doing the course not as a full-time student.

And datagen.py (or a similar named file which we will not tell you ahead of time and will be provided as the query parameter in task A1) will normally be called by evaluate.py\nInside the docker container, permission for the data folder is set by the Dockerfile\nwhich then allows your application to access the root folder inside your docker image and create the /data folder.\nSo the workflow is like this (for your internal testing only… please follow the Project page for deliverables and evaluation to submit project successfully):\nYou create your application server that serves 2 endpoints on localhost:8000\nYou create a docker image that runs this application server.\nYou run the docker image using podman as described in the project page.\nFor mimicking the testing conditions. You need two files:\nevaluate.py and datagen.py to be in the same folder where you are running these two scripts.\nRun evalute.py using uv.\nIf your docker image is correctly configured and your application is correctly configured, then all the tasks run by evaluate.py will correctly tell you if the application is producing the right result for each task.\nHope that gives clarity.\nKind regards",

Key concepts, such as Large Language Models (LLMs) and related technologies, are not explained in a structured manner, making it difficult for students to follow.\nR1: sir i watch live session recording , but still not getting some useful from it , I am talking about week 3 content in llm , these words are never heard by us so please try to tech from basic things please . At least tell us , what is llm and what is use of , everything is going to above of our head .\nR2: Hi Hari,\nThe goal of the course was never to go deep into specific technologies, with perhaps the exception of LLMs as major tooling capability for data science. Due to the volume of the content in the first 3 weeks it was decided to at least get students sufficient information to be able to do the Graded Assignments. One of the criticisms we received last term was that the sessions were too slow because we were covering from the very basics. So it was a conscious decision to speed up and shorten the explanations. Of course this is always difficult to get right because we respond to students in sessions. This is why attending the sessions is more valuable than watching the sessions. We cannot effectively gauge what level to pitch at if the audience is silent or not involved. We can only guess the level of the vast silent mass of students. The quality of sessions only improve when the sessions are interactive and well attended.\nHave you watched this session in particular?\nIf thats insufficient for you last term we did a 2hr 48 min session on just introducing it\nfollowed by another 2 hour detailed explanation of the more advanced use cases\nBut of course does everyone want to watch 5.5 hours of sessions to understand it? That depends on the student.\nUltimately the best you can get out of sessions is by actually attending them because only then can we address gaps in understanding.\nKind regards",

    "page_content": "Q: Is it considered best practice to create a virtual environment rather than installing packages globally, especially when working on projects that require multiple libraries? I understand that in a professional setting, we often work on multiple projects simultaneously, and developing the habit of using virtual environments now can help reinforce this practice for future projects.\nAdditionally, when managing dependencies, would it be better to install packages individually using pip or list them in a requirements.txt file? My understanding is that if a version is not specified in the requirements.txt file, it installs the latest available version, whereas specifying a version ensures a specific installation. However, I have encountered instances where a specific version failed to install, requiring me to modify the requirements.txt file and remove the version constraint. In such cases, wouldn’t installing directly via pip be more practical?\nThat said, I also recognize that different projects may have unique dependency requirements. I’d appreciate your insights on best practices for managing dependencies efficiently.\nR1: Yes, using a virtual environment is definitely considered best practice when working on Python projects. This approach helps avoid dependency conflicts between projects and ensures a consistent development environment. The main reasons why you should use virtual environments:\nIsolation – Each project has its own set of dependencies, preventing conflicts with other projects.\nReproducibility – A virtual environment ensures that all contributors work with the same dependencies.\nPortability – You can share a project with others (or deploy it) without worrying about system-wide package versions interfering.\nInstalling with pip individually (pip install package-name)\n• Good for quick experimentation and testing.\n• Not ideal for long-term project management because dependencies might update and break compatibility over time.\nUsing requirements.txt\n• Best for reproducibility and collaboration since others can install the exact same dependencies using pip install -r requirements.txt.\n• Avoids issues where one developer uses an updated library that breaks compatibility with another developer’s setup.\nSpecifying Versions in requirements.txt\n• If you don’t specify a version, pip install -r requirements.txt will install the latest available versions, which might introduce unexpected breaking changes.\n• If you do specify a version (package==1.2.3), you ensure consistency but may run into problems if that version becomes unavailable or has compatibility issues.\nHandling Version Conflicts\n• If a package version fails to install, try removing the strict version constraint and reinstall.\n• Instead of completely omitting version numbers, consider:\n• Using greater than/less than constraints: package>=1.2,<2.0",

It’s completely IIT Madras’s fault since it was mentioned in the academics site that no prerequisites were required for the course while the reality turned out to be far from promises. I want to either get the course structure for the TDS revised or get it replaced with some another course; incase of some course fee difference, I will pay the difference amount.\nR1: i think you would have to mail this to the support\nR2: , please do share the response you receive (or maybe already have) from Support, regarding this, here.",

Could this issue also be caused by accessing the assignment from multiple devices?\nR1: Hi Shalini,\nWe are aware of the issue and .anand is working on a solution. The temporary fix is to just reenter all the answers before hitting the Save button. Thanks for the reminder, please bear with the inconvenience while its being fixed.\nThe last submission is always saved. So please make sure that your last submission contains all the answers for all the questions.\nKind regards\nR2: Hello,\nI am also facing the same issue. In my last submission the score was 7.25. Right now it is showing 0. The problem is i had few questions remaining to solve and i dont know which ones now. All of them r showing empty in the solution box. Also i didnt write my answers someplace else, so i would have to solve all the questions again? And also if i just for example for testing submit solution of 1 question now then my score would get reduced from 7.25 to the marks of that 1 question i submitted right?\nR3: Saved multiple times on the graded website as well submitted yes on the course tab but the score keeps resetting to 0 with no progress saved\nPlease check this fix. It may solve your problem.\nGA1 - Development Tools - Discussion Thread [TDS Jan 2025] Tools in Data Science\nI added a “Recent saves” feature.\nThis will show the time and score for the last 3 times you saved. You can load from any of these.\n[image]\nDo remember to click the “Check” button to calculate your score. That is not automatic.\nPlease check this out and let me know if there are any bugs.

While I understand the necessity of these tutorials, they lack immediate exercises, which makes it difficult to retain the knowledge gained. Attempting to practice everything from these tutorials leaves insufficient time for other courses.\nAdditionally, while solving GAs helps reinforce learning, they don’t seem to cover all the concepts from the tutorials.\nI would want to know whether the learning from GAs is sufficient or if there’s a better way to balance this.\nPS - To address this at a management level, my suggestion would be to introduce AQs or mini exercises after each module. Alternatively, we could increase questions in GAs to cover more concepts, though the first approach might be more effective. Another improvement could be to reduce the diversity of content in a single week to make it more manageable.",
